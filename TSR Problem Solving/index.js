// General Coding Logic

// 1. Write a function that accepts an integer and returns true if it's evenly divisible by 5, otherwise return false
// 2. Write a program that prints the next 20 leap years.

// var yearsPrinted = 0
// var currentYear = 2017 

// function leapYears() {
//   while (yearsPrinted < 30) { 
//     if ((currentYear % 4 === 0) && (!((currentYear % 100 ===0) && (currentYear % 400 !== 0)))) {

//       document.write(currentYear + '<br>')
//       yearsPrinted++
//       currentYear++
//     } else {
//       currentYear++
//     }
//   }       
// }

// leapYears()

// 3. Write a function that returns the number of vowels and consonants in a string (as separate values)
// 4. Write a function that takes a string containing a sentence or (body of text) and a second string containing a word and returns the number of times the word appears in the string
// 5. Write a function that takes a number and returns the volume of a sphere with that diameter



// SQL

// 1. Write an SQL query to find the user “jimbob”
// 2. Write an SQL query to find all of the posts created by user “the_gary”
// 3. Write an SQL query to find all posts by “the_gary”, with a status of ‘published’, created this year.


// Problem Solving

// Using language(s) and tool(s) of your choice, design and build a simple login page. 
// The page should contain a username and password field, as well as a login button.
// If the username entered was "admin" and the password entered was "letmein", then show a welcome message;
// Otherwise show an access denied message.
